    """
        On swap event: this is a method defined by redwood. It is called when channel.send() is
        called in the javascript. That happens when
            1) someone starts a trade request by pressing the trade button,
            2) someone responds to a trade request by pressing the yes or no button,
            3) someone enters the service room and the entire queue moves forward.

        This method essentially defines a state machine. Each player has a state, represented by
        a dictionary with keys:
            id: id in group; a number from 1 to Constants.players_per_group,

            pos: position in queue at time of input; a number from -Constants.players_per_group to
                Constants.players_per_group,

            in_trade: boolean - true if this player has
                1) requested a trade and awaits a response;
                2) has been requested and has not yet responded,

            last_trade_request: timestamp of the last time this player clicked the trade button,

            requested: if this player has been requested to swap, the id of the player who made
                the request; None, or a number from 1 to Constants.players_per_group,

            requesting: if this player has made a request to swap, the id of the player who the
                request was made to; None, or a number from 1 to Constants.players_per_group,

            accepted: status of trade acceptance; 2 if requesting/no response/not in trade,
                1 if accepted, 0 if declined,

            alert: the current alert displayed to a player; a value in Constants.alert_messages,

            num_players_queue: the number of players who have not entered the service room at
                time of input; a number from 0 to Constants.players_per_group,

            num_players_service: the number of players who have entered the service room at
                time of input; a number from 0 to Constants.players_per_group,

            next; boolean: true if someone's service time has just run out, false otherwise;
                this is true when someone has passed into the service room, and everyone in
                the queue should move forward one position.

        The state machine takes in the state of each player, and alters the states of that
        player and other players accordingly.

        Note that upon this method being called, only one player's state can be different than it was
        directly before the method was called; because each time an event occurs,
        (request, response, or next) this method gets called.

        After updating all player's states, sends the data back to the client.
